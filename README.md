# Netflix Clone - A Responsive Front-End Replica

I built this project to challenge myself by replicating the complex, real-world user interface of the Netflix homepage. My goal was to create a visually faithful and fully responsive clone using only core front-end technologies to sharpen my HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript skills.

## ✨ Features I Built

-   **Fully Responsive Design:** I wrote the CSS from scratch using a mobile-first approach to ensure the site looks and works perfectly on all devices, from small phones to large desktops.
-   **Interactive FAQ Accordion:** I built the FAQ section using vanilla JavaScript to create a smooth, animated accordion where only one answer can be visible at a time, just like the real website.
-   **Custom Language Dropdown:** The language selector is a custom component I created to mimic the Netflix functionality, including a dropdown menu that intelligently closes when you click outside of it.
-   **Scrolling Content Carousels:** I used modern CSS to create the horizontally scrolling movie poster sections, a signature feature of the Netflix UI.

## 🛠️ My Tech Stack

I chose to build this project without any frameworks to demonstrate a strong command of the fundamentals.

-   **HTML5:** Used semantic markup for a well-structured and accessible site.
-   **CSS3:** Leveraged **CSS Variables** for a clean and maintainable design system and **Flexbox** for modern, responsive layouts.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript:** Wrote clean, efficient JS for all interactive components, wrapped in an IIFE to keep the global scope clean and organized.

## 🎯 What I Learned

Building this clone was a fantastic learning experience. Here are some of my key takeaways:

-   **Advanced CSS:** Gained deeper experience with responsive design, CSS variables for theming, and recreating complex, professional layouts.
-   **DOM Manipulation:** Sharpened my vanilla JavaScript skills by building interactive components like the accordion and dropdown menu from scratch.
-   **Attention to Detail:** Learned the importance of pixel-perfect design and the process of replicating the look and feel of a major, real-world web application.
